# Earthquake Challenge

## Summary
In this challenge, I was tasked to add another layer showing the tectonic plates to the maps we had already created from the earthquake data from USGS.  The earthquakes map shows all earthquakes in the last 7 days with a magnitude greater than 4.5.  This json data was collected from the USGS website.  The tectonic plates layer was added by using json data also from the USGS site.  In addition to the earthquakes and tectonic plates layers, I added another layer to show different color and radius size circles dependent on the size of the earthquake.  The finished product has 3 different selections for Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes.  I also added another map style on a new tile layer "Dark".  This gives the map 3 different map style views: Streets, Satellite, and Dark. I also ceated custom style functions for each different version of the maps.  The radius of the circles are relational to the magnitude of the earthquakes.  Also the color of the circle on the "Major Earthquakes" layer is depending on magnitude.
